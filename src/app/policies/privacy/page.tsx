      <p>The controller responsible for the processing described in this Policy is:</p>
      <ContactBlock />

      <p>The Service is available only to individuals who are at least 18 years old.</p>
      <p>
        We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If we reasonably believe that an individual under
        18 has created an Account or used the Service, we may close the Account and delete or restrict the relevant
        data, except where retention is legally required.
      </p>
      <p>If you believe that a minor has provided personal data to us, contact {brand.contact.email}.</p>

      </p>
      <p>
        At the date of publication, Datumskins does not use third-party advertising cookies, behavioural

      <h3>4.9 Special-category data</h3>
      <p>
        We do not intentionally request or process data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions,

      <p>At the date of publication, Datumskins does not use personal data for behavioural advertising or third-party analytics.</p>
      <p>Where processing is based on consent, you may withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal does not affect processing that occurred before consent was withdrawn.</p>
      <h3>6.5 Legal claims and unlawful activity</h3>
      <p>Where necessary, personal data may also be processed to establish, exercise or defend legal claims, prevent unlawful activity, or protect the rights and safety of users, ULTRASENS and third parties.</p>

      <h2>7. Steam Login</h2>
      <p>Steam Login allows us to authenticate your SteamID without receiving your Steam password.</p>
      <p>When you use Steam Login:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>you are redirected to or interact with Steam;</li>
        <li>Steam authenticates your credentials;</li>
        <li>Steam returns an identifier confirming the relevant Steam Account; and</li>
        <li>we may retrieve public Steam profile information needed for the Service.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Steam acts independently in relation to its own authentication systems and processing activities. Your use of Steam remains subject to Steam&rsquo;s terms and privacy documentation.</p>
      <p>You should access Steam Login only through an official Steam domain and must never provide Steam credentials directly to Datumskins or a Fulfilment Provider.</p>

      <h2>8. Payment Processing</h2>
      <p>Payments are processed through authorised third-party payment service providers.</p>
      <p>A payment provider may process:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>cardholder name;</li>
        <li>billing address;</li>
        <li>complete card details;</li>
        <li>authentication data;</li>
        <li>device and IP information;</li>
        <li>fraud-prevention signals; and</li>
        <li>other information required to authorise or process the payment.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The payment provider may act as our processor for some activities and as an independent controller for regulatory, fraud-prevention and financial compliance activities.</p>
      <p>We may change payment providers without changing the purposes described in this Policy. The identity of a particular provider may be made available during checkout, through the payment interface, or upon a valid data protection request where required by law.</p>

      <h2>9. Digital Item Supply and Fulfilment Providers</h2>
      <p>Delivery may be performed by a confidential Digital Item supplier, inventory provider, bot operator or current holder of the Item.</p>
      <p>To complete and verify delivery, we may provide a Fulfilment Provider with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>SteamID;</li>
        <li>Trade URL;</li>
        <li>internal Order identifier;</li>
        <li>selected Digital Item and asset information;</li>
        <li>delivery instructions;</li>
        <li>relevant Trade Offer information; and</li>
        <li>delivery status.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Fulfilment Providers are not permitted to receive your Steam password, Steam Guard code, full card information or unrelated personal data from us.</p>
      <p>The commercial identity of a Fulfilment Provider may remain confidential. However, this does not restrict any right you have under applicable data protection law to receive information about actual recipients of your personal data where disclosure is legally required.</p>

      <h2>10. Other Recipients of Personal Data</h2>
      <p>We may disclose personal data to the following categories of recipients where necessary:</p>
      <ul>

        <li>fraud-prevention and compliance providers;</li>
        <li>courts, regulators, law enforcement and other authorities;</li>
        <li>a purchaser, investor or successor in connection with a genuine corporate transaction; and</li>
        <li>other persons where you have instructed or authorised us to disclose the data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Service providers may access personal data only to the extent necessary for the relevant service and must be subject to appropriate confidentiality and data protection obligations.</p>
      <p>We do not sell personal data or share it for third-party behavioural advertising.</p>

      <h2>11. International Data Transfers</h2>
      <p>Steam, payment providers, Fulfilment Providers or infrastructure providers may operate in countries outside Lithuania or the European Economic Area (&ldquo;EEA&rdquo;).</p>
      <p>Where personal data is transferred outside the EEA, we will ensure that the transfer has a lawful basis and appropriate safeguards where required. These may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>an adequacy decision adopted by the European Commission;</li>
        <li>the European Commission&rsquo;s Standard Contractual Clauses;</li>
        <li>supplementary contractual, organisational or technical measures;</li>
        <li>another legally recognised transfer mechanism; or</li>
        <li>a specific GDPR derogation where applicable.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You may contact us for information about the safeguards applicable to a particular transfer. Some information may be redacted where necessary to protect security, confidentiality or third-party rights, without restricting the substance of your legal rights.</p>

      <h2>12. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>We retain personal data only for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this Policy, including legal, accounting, security and dispute-resolution requirements.</p>
      <p>The applicable retention criteria include:</p>
      <h3>Account and Steam profile data</h3>
      <p>Retained while the Account is active and for a limited period after closure where necessary to prevent fraud, process remaining requests, resolve disputes or establish legal claims. Public Steam profile information may be refreshed, replaced or deleted when no longer needed.</p>
      <h3>Trade URL</h3>
      <p>Retained while needed for active or reasonably anticipated deliveries. A replaced Trade URL may remain in historical security or transaction records where necessary to investigate a completed or disputed Order.</p>
      <h3>Order, invoice and payment records</h3>
      <p>Retained for the period required by Lithuanian accounting, tax, consumer protection and other applicable laws, and for the period necessary to manage disputes, refunds or legal claims.</p>
      <h3>Trade and delivery records</h3>
      <p>Retained for as long as reasonably necessary to prove delivery, investigate reversals, prevent duplicate refunds, resolve payment disputes and establish or defend legal claims.</p>
      <h3>Technical and security logs</h3>
      <p>Retained for a limited security and diagnostic period. Relevant logs may be retained longer where connected to suspected fraud, a security incident, a disputed transaction or legal proceedings.</p>
      <h3>Support communications</h3>
      <p>Retained until the request is resolved and for a reasonable period afterwards where necessary to maintain service history, handle follow-up complaints or defend legal claims.</p>
      <h3>Compliance information</h3>
      <p>Retained only for as long as necessary for the applicable review, legal obligation, restriction or investigation.</p>
      <p>When retention is no longer necessary, data will be deleted, anonymised or securely isolated unless continued retention is legally required.</p>

      <h2>13. Automated Processing</h2>
      <p>Payment providers and security systems may use automated tools to identify suspicious activity, assess transaction risk or approve or decline a payment.</p>
      <p>Datumskins does not currently use personal data for behavioural advertising or profiling unrelated to transaction security.</p>
      <p>We do not intend to make decisions based solely on automated processing that produce legal or similarly significant effects, except where:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the processing is necessary to enter into or perform a contract;</li>
        <li>the processing is authorised by law;</li>
        <li>you have provided explicit consent where legally permitted; or</li>
        <li>the decision is made independently by a payment provider under its own legal responsibilities.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Where applicable law provides such a right, you may request human review, express your point of view and contest an automated decision by contacting us.</p>

      <h2>14. Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
      <p>Subject to applicable law, you may have the following rights.</p>
      <h3>14.1 Right of access</h3>
      <p>You may ask whether we process your personal data and request a copy of that data, together with information about its processing.</p>
      <h3>14.2 Right to rectification</h3>
      <p>You may ask us to correct inaccurate personal data or complete incomplete data. Some Steam information must be corrected through Steam before the updated information can be retrieved by Datumskins.</p>
      <h3>14.3 Right to erasure</h3>
      <p>You may ask us to delete personal data where:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>it is no longer necessary;</li>
        <li>consent has been withdrawn and no other legal basis applies;</li>
        <li>you have successfully objected to the processing;</li>
        <li>the data was processed unlawfully; or</li>
        <li>deletion is required by law.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The right to erasure does not apply where retention remains necessary for legal compliance, accounting, fraud prevention, legal claims or another lawful purpose.</p>
      <h3>14.4 Right to restriction</h3>
      <p>You may ask us to restrict processing while:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>data accuracy is being verified;</li>
        <li>an objection is being considered;</li>
        <li>the processing is unlawful but you oppose deletion; or</li>
        <li>we no longer need the data but you require it for a legal claim.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>14.5 Right to data portability</h3>
      <p>Where processing is based on consent or contract and performed by automated means, you may request relevant personal data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format.</p>
      <h3>14.6 Right to object</h3>
      <p>You may object to processing based on legitimate interests. We will stop the relevant processing unless we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds that override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing remains necessary for legal claims.</p>
      <p>You may object to direct marketing at any time. Datumskins does not currently send behavioural advertising or share data for such advertising.</p>
      <h3>14.7 Right to withdraw consent</h3>
      <p>Where processing is based on consent, you may withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of processing performed before withdrawal.</p>
      <h3>14.8 Right concerning automated decisions</h3>
      <p>Where applicable, you may request human intervention and contest a decision based solely on automated processing that produces legal or similarly significant effects.</p>
      <h3>14.9 Right to complain</h3>
      <p>You may lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority in Lithuania or, where applicable, the authority in the EEA country of your habitual residence, place of work or alleged infringement.</p>

      <h2>15. Exercising Your Rights</h2>
      <p>Requests may be sent to: {brand.contact.email}</p>
      <p>Please use the subject line &ldquo;Data Protection Request&rdquo;.</p>
      <p>Your request should identify:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>your SteamID or Account identifier;</li>
        <li>the right you wish to exercise;</li>
        <li>the information or processing concerned; and</li>
        <li>an email address through which we can respond.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We may request proportionate information to verify your identity and protect the Account from unauthorised disclosure.</p>
      <p>We will respond without undue delay and normally within one month after receiving a valid request. That period may be extended by up to two additional months where permitted because of the complexity or number of requests. If an extension is required, we will inform you.</p>
      <p>Requests are normally handled free of charge. A reasonable fee may be charged, or a request may be refused, only where permitted by law, including where a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.</p>
