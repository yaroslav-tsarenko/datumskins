      <p>
        Please read these Terms carefully before using the Service or placing an order. By creating or using an

      <h2>2. Scope of the Service</h2>
      <p>Datumskins allows eligible users to browse and purchase Digital Items displayed through the Service.</p>
      <p>
        Users may purchase Digital Items only. Datumskins does not provide users with functionality to list
        Digital Items for sale, sell Items to ULTRASENS, withdraw funds, or maintain a cash balance through the
        Service.
      </p>
      <p>For each Order accepted by us:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>ULTRASENS is the contractual seller responsible to you for the Order;</li>
        <li>payment is collected for ULTRASENS;</li>
        <li>the invoice or other applicable transaction document is issued by ULTRASENS; and</li>
        <li>delivery may be performed by a Fulfilment Provider on our behalf.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Depending on where the selected Digital Item is held, delivery may be completed through a bot operated by
        a Fulfilment Provider or through a direct transfer from the Steam Account currently holding the Item.
      </p>
      <p>
        The identity and commercial arrangements of our Fulfilment Providers are confidential and may not be
        disclosed unless disclosure is required by applicable law, necessary to protect your legal rights, or
        necessary to complete or investigate a particular transaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our use of a Fulfilment Provider does not remove ULTRASENS&rsquo;s responsibility to you for properly
        performing an accepted Order.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
      <p>You may use the Service only if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>you are at least 18 years old;</li>
        <li>you have the legal capacity to enter into a binding contract;</li>
        <li>you have a valid Steam Account that you are authorised to use;</li>
        <li>your Steam Account is eligible to receive the relevant Digital Item;</li>
        <li>
          you are not located in, ordinarily resident in, or accessing the Service from a Restricted Jurisdiction
          identified in Section 16;
        </li>
        <li>your use of the Service is lawful in your country or territory; and</li>
        <li>you comply with these Terms and applicable Steam rules.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By using the Service, you represent that all eligibility requirements are satisfied.</p>
      <p>
        We do not knowingly permit individuals under 18 years of age to create an Account or purchase Digital
        Items. We may suspend an Account or cancel an Order if we reasonably believe that the age requirement has
        not been met.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Steam Login and Account Registration</h2>
      <p>A Steam Account is required to create an Account and purchase Digital Items.</p>
      <p>
        Authentication is performed using Steam Login. Datumskins does not ask for or receive your Steam
        password through the Steam Login process. You must never provide your Steam password, Steam Guard code,
        authentication code, API key, recovery code, or other security credentials to anyone claiming to
        represent Datumskins.
      </p>
      <p>Your Account is personal to you. You must not:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>create an Account using another person&rsquo;s Steam Account;</li>
        <li>allow another person to use your Account;</li>
        <li>transfer or sell your Account;</li>
        <li>connect a Trade URL belonging to a different Steam Account;</li>
        <li>create multiple Accounts to circumvent restrictions, limits or enforcement measures; or</li>
        <li>access an Account without the account holder&rsquo;s permission.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Steam Account, email account, devices and
        sessions. You must promptly contact us if you suspect unauthorised access to your Account or an Order that
        you did not place.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may require you to confirm account details or provide information reasonably necessary to prevent
        fraud, verify eligibility, comply with applicable law, or resolve a transaction problem.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Nature of Digital Items</h2>
      <p>
        Digital Items exist within and depend on Steam. They are not physical goods and are not delivered outside
        the Steam environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        A purchase through Datumskins gives you the contractual right to receive the selected Digital Item in
        the connected Steam Account, subject to these Terms, applicable law, and the rules and technical
        functionality of Steam.
      </p>
      <p>
        Digital Items may constitute limited digital licence rights rather than property owned in the same manner
        as physical goods. Your ability to possess, display, use, modify or transfer an Item remains subject to
        Steam&rsquo;s terms, technical rules, account restrictions and continued operation.
      </p>
      <p>Datumskins does not control Steam and cannot guarantee that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Steam will remain continuously available;</li>
        <li>Steam will continue supporting a particular Digital Item or transfer mechanism;</li>
        <li>Valve will not change its rules, restrictions or technical systems;</li>
        <li>a Digital Item will remain transferable;</li>
        <li>a Digital Item will retain any particular price, rarity or level of demand; or</li>
        <li>your Steam Account will remain eligible to hold or use the Item.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Digital Items are cosmetic digital content. They do not provide guaranteed gameplay advantages and must
        not be treated as regulated financial products, deposits, savings instruments or guaranteed investments.
      </p>

      <h2>6. No Affiliation With Valve</h2>
      <p>Datumskins is an independent service.</p>
      <p>
        Unless expressly stated otherwise, ULTRASENS is not affiliated with, sponsored by, endorsed by, or acting
        on behalf of Valve Corporation, Steam, Counter-Strike 2, or any of their affiliates.
      </p>
      <p>
        All third-party names, game titles, trademarks, images and related materials belong to their respective
        owners. Their use through the Service is for identification and informational purposes.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Item Information</h2>
      <p>We aim to display accurate information about each Digital Item. Depending on the Item, this may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>item name and type;</li>
        <li>exterior or wear condition;</li>
        <li>float value;</li>
        <li>pattern or paint seed;</li>
        <li>StatTrak status;</li>
        <li>stickers, charms or other applied elements;</li>
        <li>trade restriction status;</li>
        <li>screenshots or rendered images; and</li>
        <li>price and currency.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You must review the Item description and relevant characteristics before placing an Order. Characteristics
        such as float value, pattern, sticker placement and wear can materially affect an Item&rsquo;s appearance
        and perceived value.
      </p>
      <p>
        Images may be rendered or displayed differently depending on screen settings, browser, Steam updates or
        technical limitations. Where the listing identifies a specific Item, the recorded item attributes take
        precedence over minor visual differences in a preview image.
      </p>
      <p>We will not replace the selected Item with another materially different Item without your express agreement.</p>

      <h2>8. Availability and Pricing</h2>
      <p>
        Digital Item availability is obtained through technical integrations and may change rapidly. Placing an
        Item in a cart does not necessarily reserve it.
      </p>
      <p>
        All displayed prices include VAT where applicable. Before payment, the checkout will show the total amount
        payable in the selected currency.
      </p>
      <p>Purchases may be completed in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>euros (EUR);</li>
        <li>United States dollars (USD); or</li>
        <li>pounds sterling (GBP).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You are responsible for selecting the preferred currency before confirming payment. Your card issuer may
        apply currency conversion charges, cross-border charges or other fees that are not imposed or controlled
        by ULTRASENS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Digital Item prices may change due to availability, demand, market conditions, item characteristics,
        currency changes or updated supplier information. A price change will not affect an Order after we have
        issued an Order Confirmation, except in the case of an obvious pricing or technical error that a
        reasonable person should have recognised.
      </p>
      <p>
        If an Item becomes unavailable, is incorrectly described, or is affected by an obvious pricing or
        technical error before the Order is accepted, we may reject the Order.
      </p>
      <p>If such an issue is discovered after payment, we will contact you and either:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>offer to fulfil the Order on corrected terms, subject to your express agreement; or</li>
        <li>cancel the affected Order and initiate a full refund.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>9. Order Process and Contract Formation</h2>
      <p>To place an Order, you must:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>sign in using your Steam Account;</li>
        <li>provide a valid Trade URL linked to the same Steam Account;</li>
        <li>select the Digital Item;</li>
        <li>review the Item details, total price, currency and delivery information;</li>
        <li>provide any required consents or acknowledgements;</li>
        <li>accept these Terms and the applicable policies; and</li>
        <li>submit payment.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your submission of an Order is an offer to purchase the selected Digital Item from ULTRASENS.</p>
      <p>
        An automated acknowledgement that we have received your Order does not necessarily mean that the Order has
        been accepted. The purchase contract is formed when we issue an Order Confirmation following successful
        payment authorisation.
      </p>
      <p>We may decline or cancel an Order before delivery where reasonably necessary because of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Item unavailability;</li>
        <li>payment failure or reversal;</li>
        <li>an obvious pricing or description error;</li>
        <li>suspected fraud or unauthorised payment;</li>
        <li>Steam restrictions;</li>
        <li>a technical integration error;</li>
        <li>violation of these Terms;</li>
        <li>legal, sanctions or geographic restrictions; or</li>
        <li>circumstances outside our reasonable control that prevent delivery.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If we cancel an accepted and paid Order for a reason not caused by you, we will initiate a full refund to
        the original payment method.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Payments and Invoices</h2>
      <p>
        Each Order is paid through a separate card transaction. Datumskins does not provide a stored-value
        balance or permit cash withdrawals.
      </p>
      <p>Supported card networks are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Visa; and</li>
        <li>Mastercard.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Payments are processed with the assistance of authorised third-party payment service providers. We are not
        required to identify a particular provider in these Terms and may change providers without amending these
        Terms, provided that the change does not reduce your statutory rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless expressly stated otherwise during checkout, complete card numbers and card security codes are
        submitted directly to the payment processing environment and are not stored by ULTRASENS.
      </p>
      <p>By submitting a payment, you represent that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>you are authorised to use the selected card;</li>
        <li>the billing and payment information is accurate;</li>
        <li>the payment is not connected to fraud or other unlawful activity; and</li>
        <li>the card issuer is authorised to complete the transaction.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Payment may be subject to authorisation, security screening, fraud prevention controls, card issuer
        approval or additional authentication. A payment may be declined or delayed by the payment provider or
        card issuer.
      </p>
      <p>
        An electronic invoice or other applicable transaction document will be issued by ULTRASENS and may be made
        available through your Account or sent electronically.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Delivery</h2>
      <p>Digital Items are delivered through Steam.</p>
      <p>
        Following successful payment, a Trade Offer is normally generated or sent within a few minutes. Unless a
        different delivery period is clearly disclosed before payment, we aim to complete delivery within 24 hours
        after issuing the Order Confirmation.
      </p>
      <p>Delivery times are estimates rather than guarantees where a delay results from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Steam downtime or technical problems;</li>
        <li>a Steam trade restriction, protection period or security hold;</li>
        <li>an invalid, expired or mismatched Trade URL;</li>
        <li>a private Steam profile or inventory where public access is technically required;</li>
        <li>an inventory capacity limitation;</li>
        <li>a VAC, community or trade restriction;</li>
        <li>a recent password, device, Steam Guard or account change;</li>
        <li>a security or fraud review;</li>
        <li>failure to accept the Trade Offer;</li>
        <li>action or inaction by the user; or</li>
        <li>another circumstance outside our reasonable control.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Delivery may be performed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>by a bot operated by a Fulfilment Provider; or</li>
        <li>directly from the Steam Account currently holding the selected Item.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Steam Account sending the Item may therefore have a name or profile that does not contain the
        Datumskins brand.
      </p>
      <p>
        You must carefully check every Trade Offer before accepting it. The offer must contain the Item purchased
        through Datumskins and must not require you to transfer money, another Digital Item, login credentials
        or authentication information through Steam.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a Trade Offer contains an incorrect Item or requests anything from you in return, do not accept it and
        contact us immediately.
      </p>

      <h2>12. User Delivery Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>To receive an Item, you must:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>remain signed in to the correct Steam Account;</li>
        <li>provide a valid Trade URL linked to that Account;</li>
        <li>ensure that the Account is eligible to trade;</li>
        <li>configure profile and inventory visibility as reasonably required for delivery;</li>
        <li>maintain sufficient inventory capacity;</li>
        <li>review and accept the correct Trade Offer within the displayed validity period; and</li>
        <li>comply with Steam Guard and other Steam security requirements.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Trade Offers may expire after the period shown in the Service or through Steam. If an offer expires, we may
        attempt to issue another offer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Repeated failure to accept a valid Trade Offer may delay delivery. If your action or inaction prevents
        delivery, we may ask you to correct the problem within a reasonable period.
      </p>
      <p>
        If delivery remains impossible because of your failure to meet these requirements, we may cancel the
        Order. Any refund will be handled in accordance with the Refund, Cancellation and Withdrawal Policy and
        applicable law.
      </p>

      <h2>13. Completion of Delivery</h2>
      <p>
        Delivery is completed when Steam records the transfer of the purchased Item to the Steam Account connected
        to your Datumskins Account.
      </p>
      <p>
        You must promptly review the completed transfer. If you believe that the delivered Item does not match the
        Order Confirmation, contact us without undue delay and provide the Order number, SteamID, Trade Offer
        details and supporting screenshots or records.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Steam-imposed trade protection period, cooldown, security restriction or temporary inability to
        re-transfer, modify or consume the Item does not mean that delivery has not occurred, provided that the
        correct Item has been transferred to your Steam Account.
      </p>

      <h2>14. Steam Trade Reversals</h2>
      <p>
        Steam may permit certain completed trades to be reversed during a protection period determined by Steam.
      </p>
      <p>You must not reverse or attempt to reverse a completed trade for fraudulent, abusive or unauthorised purposes.</p>
      <p>
        If you believe a trade should be reversed because of an incorrect Item, unauthorised transaction or other
        legitimate issue, contact Datumskins before taking action where reasonably possible.
      </p>
      <p>An improper reversal may result in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>suspension or termination of your Account;</li>
        <li>cancellation of pending Orders;</li>
        <li>refusal of future transactions;</li>
        <li>recovery of the Item or its value;</li>
        <li>recovery of reasonably incurred losses; and</li>
        <li>referral to the payment provider, Steam or competent authorities where appropriate.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Nothing in this Section prevents you from exercising a mandatory legal right or reporting genuine fraud.</p>

      <h2>15. Cancellation, Refunds and Withdrawal Rights</h2>
      <p>
        Refunds, cancellations and statutory withdrawal rights are governed by the Refund, Cancellation and
        Withdrawal Policy, which forms part of these Terms.
      </p>
      <p>In summary:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>if we cannot supply the purchased Item, we will cancel the affected Order and initiate a full refund;</li>
        <li>if payment was taken more than once for the same Order, the duplicate amount will be refunded;</li>
        <li>
          if the delivered Item does not conform to the Order, you may be entitled to correction, replacement, a
          price reduction, cancellation or another remedy under applicable law;
        </li>
        <li>refunds are normally made to the original payment method;</li>
        <li>bank or card processing times may apply after a refund has been initiated; and</li>
        <li>
          a change of mind does not automatically create a right to a refund after a correctly delivered Digital
          Item has been accepted.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Where applicable consumer law provides a right to withdraw from a contract for digital content or an
        immediately performed digital service, we may ask you at checkout to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>expressly request or consent to performance beginning during the withdrawal period; and</li>
        <li>
          acknowledge that you will lose the right to withdraw once performance begins or is completed, to the
          extent permitted by law.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Acceptance of these Terms alone does not constitute a waiver of a statutory withdrawal right. Your rights
        will be affected only where all legally required information, consent and acknowledgements have been
        properly provided.
      </p>
      <p>Nothing in these Terms excludes rights that cannot lawfully be excluded.</p>

      <h2>16. Restricted Jurisdictions</h2>

        <li>Zimbabwe.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These territories are restricted for legal, compliance, risk management or business reasons. Their
        inclusion does not necessarily mean that every listed territory is subject to the same legal restrictions.
      </p>
      <p>
        You must not use a VPN, proxy, false address, third-party payment instrument or other method to conceal or
        misrepresent your location or residence.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may also restrict a transaction where it involves a person, entity, wallet, card, bank, account or
        activity subject to applicable sanctions or other legal restrictions.
      </p>

      <h2>17. Acceptable Use</h2>
      <p>You must use the Service lawfully and in good faith.</p>
      <p>You must not:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>use stolen, fraudulent or unauthorised payment details;</li>
        <li>impersonate another person or misrepresent your identity, age or location;</li>

        <li>introduce malware, malicious code or harmful content;</li>
        <li>overload or disrupt the Service;</li>
        <li>conceal access from a Restricted Jurisdiction;</li>
        <li>use the Service in violation of Steam rules;</li>
        <li>infringe intellectual property, privacy or other third-party rights; or</li>
        <li>assist another person in any prohibited activity.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You remain entitled to raise a genuine payment dispute or consumer complaint. However, you should contact
        us first where reasonably possible so that we can investigate and attempt to resolve the issue.
      </p>

      <h2>18. Security and Compliance Reviews</h2>
      <p>We may review an Account, Order or payment where reasonably necessary to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>prevent fraud or account misuse;</li>
        <li>confirm payment authorisation;</li>
        <li>verify age, location or eligibility;</li>
        <li>investigate a disputed transaction;</li>
        <li>protect users, ULTRASENS or third parties;</li>
        <li>enforce these Terms; or</li>
        <li>comply with applicable law or a lawful authority request.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We may request additional information where proportionate and permitted by law. We will not claim that a
        particular identity verification or compliance process applies unless it is actually implemented for the
        relevant transaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        An Order may be delayed, declined or cancelled if requested information is not provided or if we cannot
        reasonably resolve a material security or compliance concern.
      </p>

      <h2>19. Suspension and Termination</h2>
      <p>We may temporarily restrict, suspend or terminate access to the Service where we reasonably believe that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>you have materially or repeatedly violated these Terms;</li>
        <li>the Account is being used without authorisation;</li>
        <li>your activity presents a fraud, security or legal risk;</li>
        <li>you are accessing from a Restricted Jurisdiction;</li>
        <li>a payment has been reversed or disputed;</li>
        <li>suspension is required by Steam, a payment provider or a competent authority; or</li>
        <li>restriction is reasonably necessary to protect the Service or another person.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Where appropriate, we will inform you of the reason for the restriction and provide an opportunity to
        contact support. We may withhold specific security or fraud-detection details where disclosure would
        create a risk or violate applicable law.
      </p>
      <p>
        If an Account is terminated, unfulfilled paid Orders will be cancelled and refunded unless payment is
        subject to a legitimate dispute, reversal, legal hold or another lawful restriction.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may request closure of your Account by contacting us. Account closure does not require us to delete
        information that must be retained for accounting, fraud prevention, dispute resolution or legal
        compliance.
      </p>

      <h2>20. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        The Service depends on third-party systems, including Steam, payment processing services, hosting
        infrastructure and Fulfilment Providers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your use of Steam remains governed by Steam&rsquo;s own terms and privacy documentation. Datumskins
        does not control Steam account suspensions, trade restrictions, security holds, technical downtime or
        changes to Steam functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are not responsible for a third party&rsquo;s independent acts or systems where they are genuinely
        outside our reasonable control. However, this does not remove ULTRASENS&rsquo;s obligations concerning an
        accepted Order, including the obligation to provide an appropriate remedy where delivery cannot be
        completed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Links to third-party websites are provided for convenience or necessary functionality. We are not
        responsible for unrelated content, offers or conduct on external websites.
      </p>

      <h2>21. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>
        The Datumskins website, branding, layout, software, databases, text, graphics and original content are
        owned by or licensed to ULTRASENS and are protected by applicable intellectual property laws.
      </p>
      <p>
        Subject to these Terms, we grant you a limited, personal, revocable, non-exclusive and non-transferable
        right to access and use the Service for lawful personal purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        You must not reproduce, modify, distribute, sell, license, reverse engineer or commercially exploit any
        part of the Service unless expressly permitted by law or authorised by us in writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        No rights in Valve, Steam, Counter-Strike 2 or third-party Digital Item content are transferred to you by
        ULTRASENS except the limited ability to receive and use the Item through Steam in accordance with the
        applicable third-party terms.
      </p>

      <h2>22. Privacy</h2>
      <p>Personal data is processed in accordance with the Datumskins Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p>Depending on how you use the Service, processed data may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>SteamID and public Steam profile information;</li>
        <li>Trade URL and public inventory information;</li>
        <li>Account, Order and Trade Offer records;</li>
        <li>payment status and limited payment metadata;</li>
        <li>IP address, approximate location and security logs; and</li>
        <li>communications with support.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do not receive your Steam password through Steam Login and do not intend to store complete card numbers
        or card security codes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data may be shared with payment service providers, hosting and security providers, professional advisers,
        authorities where legally required, and digital item supply and fulfilment providers where necessary to
        complete an Order.
      </p>

      <h2>23. Service Availability and Changes</h2>
      <p>We aim to keep the Service available and accurate, but uninterrupted or error-free operation cannot be guaranteed.</p>
      <p>
        We may maintain, update, modify, restrict or discontinue features where reasonably necessary for security,
        legal compliance, technical operation or business reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where a change materially affects an accepted Order, we will continue to honour the Order or provide an
        appropriate remedy. Changes to the Service do not remove rights already acquired under a completed purchase
        contract.
      </p>

      <h2>24. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
      <p>
        We will provide the Service with reasonable care and skill and will supply Digital Items in conformity
        with accepted Orders.
      </p>
      <p>Subject to mandatory law, we do not guarantee:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>uninterrupted availability of the website or Steam;</li>
        <li>future transferability or usability of an Item;</li>
        <li>future market value, demand or rarity;</li>
        <li>compatibility with future Steam or game updates;</li>
        <li>that an Item will meet a subjective investment or collection objective; or</li>
        <li>the continued availability of any particular Item.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Nothing in these Terms excludes any legal guarantee or conformity right that applies to consumers.</p>

      <h2>25. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        ULTRASENS is responsible for loss or damage that is a reasonably foreseeable result of our breach of these
        Terms or our failure to exercise legally required care.
      </p>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not responsible for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>losses that were not reasonably foreseeable when the contract was formed;</li>
        <li>losses caused exclusively by your breach of these Terms;</li>
        <li>loss resulting from unauthorised access caused by your failure to protect your Steam Account or devices;</li>
        <li>loss caused by a Steam restriction that we did not cause and could not reasonably prevent;</li>
        <li>changes in the price, popularity, rarity or transferability of a Digital Item;</li>
        <li>
          loss of anticipated profit, revenue or business opportunity where the Service was obtained for personal
          use; or
        </li>
        <li>indirect or consequential loss that applicable law allows us to exclude.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, our aggregate liability arising from an individual Order will not
        exceed the amount paid to us for that Order.
      </p>
      <p>Nothing in these Terms limits or excludes liability for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation;</li>
        <li>intentional misconduct or gross negligence;</li>
        <li>death or personal injury where liability cannot lawfully be excluded;</li>
        <li>failure to supply an accepted and paid Order without providing an appropriate remedy;</li>
        <li>breach of mandatory consumer rights; or</li>
        <li>any other liability that cannot lawfully be limited.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>26. Complaints</h2>
      <p>Complaints may be submitted to: {brand.contact.email}</p>
      <p>Please include, where applicable:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>your name;</li>

        <li>Order number;</li>

        <li>a clear description of the issue; and</li>
        <li>relevant screenshots or supporting records.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We will review consumer complaints free of charge and provide a reasoned written response as soon as
        reasonably possible and no later than 14 days after receiving the complaint, where required by Lithuanian
        law.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a consumer dispute cannot be resolved directly, an eligible consumer may contact the Lithuanian State
        Consumer Rights Protection Authority:

      <h2>27. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
      <p>These Terms and contracts formed under them are governed by the laws of the Republic of Lithuania.</p>
      <p>
        If you are a consumer, this choice of law does not deprive you of mandatory protections provided by the
        laws of the country in which you are habitually resident where those protections apply regardless of the
        chosen law.
      </p>
      <p>
        Disputes may be submitted to the competent courts of Lithuania, subject to any mandatory right of a
        consumer to bring or defend proceedings before the courts of their country of residence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before starting court proceedings, the parties should attempt to resolve the dispute through the
        complaints process described above, without limiting either party&rsquo;s legal rights or applicable
        limitation periods.
      </p>

      <h2>28. Changes to These Terms</h2>
      <p>We may amend these Terms to reflect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>changes to the Service;</li>
        <li>changes to Steam functionality;</li>
        <li>legal or regulatory requirements;</li>
        <li>security and fraud prevention needs;</li>
        <li>payment or fulfilment changes; or</li>
        <li>reasonable business developments.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The updated version will be published on the website with a revised effective date.</p>
      <p>
        Material changes will apply prospectively. They will not alter an accepted Order unless required by law or
        expressly agreed with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Continued use of the Service after updated Terms take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms
        where permitted by law. If you do not agree, you must stop using the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>29. General Provisions</h2>
      <h3>29.1 Entire Agreement</h3>
      <p>
        These Terms, the Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, Refund, Cancellation and Withdrawal Policy, Digital Item
        Delivery Policy, and any additional terms shown before payment constitute the agreement between you and
        ULTRASENS concerning the Service and relevant Orders.
      </p>
      <h3>29.2 Order of Precedence</h3>
      <p>
        If specific information shown during checkout conflicts with these Terms, the checkout information will
        apply to that Order to the extent of the conflict. Mandatory law will always prevail.
      </p>
      <h3>29.3 Severability</h3>
      <p>
        If a provision is found invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue to apply. The
        invalid provision will be interpreted or replaced only to the minimum extent necessary to make it lawful
        and enforceable.
      </p>
      <h3>29.4 No Waiver</h3>
      <p>A delay or failure to enforce a provision does not waive the right to enforce it later.</p>
      <h3>29.5 Assignment</h3>
      <p>You may not transfer your rights or obligations under these Terms without our written consent.</p>
      <p>
        We may transfer our rights or obligations as part of a merger, restructuring, business transfer or similar
        transaction, provided that this does not reduce your mandatory rights.
      </p>
      <h3>29.6 Force Majeure</h3>
      <p>
        Neither party is responsible for delay caused by events genuinely outside its reasonable control. This
        does not affect your right to a refund or other mandatory remedy where an Order cannot be completed.
      </p>
      <h3>29.7 Electronic Communications</h3>
      <p>
        You agree that Order Confirmations, invoices, policies, notices and other transaction communications may
        be provided electronically through the Service or by email.
      </p>
      <h3>29.8 Language</h3>
      <p>
        These Terms are prepared in English. Any translation is provided for convenience unless applicable law
        requires otherwise. Mandatory consumer protections concerning language and transparency remain unaffected.
